  SQLite Operations:
    INNER JOIN:
      * This operation returns rows from a table with corresponding rows from another table based on the join condition.
      * INNER JOIN can be used to find the associated entries made by a user based on the user id or other identifiers.
    LEFT JOIN:
      * This operation returns rows from a table that can have corresponding rows from another table based on the join condition. The rows that do not have corresponding rows from the other table will have NULL values in place of the values from the other table.
      * LEFT JOIN can be used to identify the entries for each topic where each topic can have one or more entr(ies) or no entry as represented by NULL.
    CROSS JOIN: 
      * This operation returns a set of size N x M where N is the number of rows from a table and M is the number of rows from another table.
      * CROSS JOIN can be used to identify all entries made for each relevant user. This can be useful in display all the entries made by a user under that user's page in our setup.

  PROGRAMMING SUCKS
  What Will We Do To Make Our Team More Awesome
  1. Complete code in steps, to make sure that even if we do something and it breaks everything, we can clearly go back to the previous version and figure out what was wrong (and make sure to let each other know what was wrong so that we can learn from it)
  2. Don't always turn to Google/StackOverflow/Quora when an error pops up, because many people on the Internet don't actually know what they're talking about since no one really knows what they're talking about and instead we should just consider amongst ourselves and possibly other classmates 
  3. Communicate well in our team, or else Fred will make walkways that no one actually asked for and Tom and Harry will probably enter a fist fight over the correct standards to use and no one will understand what Phil is doing and someone (or all of us) will end up completing the project at 4 AM on Monday right before dawn
  
  Bonus: No matter what the problem is, always consider whether it would be smart to just restart your computer before you make it worse...
